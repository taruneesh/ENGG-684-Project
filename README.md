# ENGG-684-Project

The client, Elaine Musk, needs a vaccine prototype to be developed geared towards combating the global COVID 19 pandemic. To achieve this goal, the client requires that an emergency laboratory be set up in a limited time frame.   
This project plan is to support the design and construction of an emergency laboratory to develop the COVID 19 vaccine prototype within the given time constraints. The biomedical design approach would be employed in this project plan. The laboratory, although it would be set up within a short time frame, would be cost effective, most adequate and in compliance with relevant government codes and regulations.
